# When does the copyright of Clason's "The Richest Man in Babylon" expire

## Todd Gardiner

This is a very complicated case. Much like the song "Happy Birthday To You", if Clason's estate challenges someone for copyright infringement, they would have to defend the facts about the copyright status of the book.

The book was published in 1926. Let's set the outside date, by current law. If the work was legitimately copyrighted in 1926, renewed in 1963 and then we go by the 95 year copyright date, which makes the last year of copyright protection 2021 ([Reference: Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm))

There are facts to establish, however. The book is a collection of pamphlets that were distributed to banks and insurance companies before collection. What date those works were printed would have to be established, or how the book is a derivative work (adding new material, rather than just being a copy) would have to be demonstrated, thus the book would be worthy of a unique copyright.

If this is not a derivative work, then we go by the dates of the pamphlets. Any work published before 1923 went into the public domain long ago. If all of the pamphlets were expired, so is the book (again, if it is not a derivative work with new material).

If that is all established to be okay, then we have to look at the next copyright hurdle: was proper copyright notice included in the book? If not, no copyright.

But let's assume that was done properly (it usually is). The next hurdle is: was this properly renewed in 1954? That's an excellent question. This might not have happened. George Samuel Clason was 80 in that year. If not, then the work is in the public domain. A 1960 study by the copyright office found that only 7% of books had been renewed. Here is a FAQ on that: How To Find Out Whether a Copyright Was Renewed?

Note, the "Life-plus-70-years" term for copyright duration is not used for works published before 1978. Only works published in 1978 or more recent have a duration this long (or unpublished works, but that's not relevant here). The duration for pre-1978 works is 95 years, and less in many circumstances.

Actually, the record of public domain renewals shows George Clason DID renew the rights, therefore, the rights will end in 2,021â€¦
